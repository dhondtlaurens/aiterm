/// The sidebar's foot, on the list's grid: SYSTEM, then USAGE, split by a rule. SYSTEM is the
/// selected task's or terminal's context — its active tab's mark, `ctx`, the ring and the fill — then
/// the Mac (proposal 1A · 2A · 3A, 6 Oct 2026): its readings, `cpu ◔ 23% · ram ◔ 61%` and `bat` on
/// battery, under its `macbook` mark, and while Backpack Mode is on or switching, a line in a
/// `SettingsTone` — `● backpack enabled`. At the desk there is no such line: the readings row is the
/// Mac's row, and its click is ⌘B. USAGE is one row per vendor with its account windows:
/// `Ⓒ wk ◔ 84% Mon 21:00 · 5h ◔ 23% 16:40`. With nothing selected SYSTEM holds the Mac alone.
///
/// It sits on the list's grid rather than its own (proposal A, 23 Sep 2026): the headings are the
/// `PROJECTS` header's treatment, the rows are ``Size/menuRow`` like the header and `DividerRow`,
/// and the ink runs from the header's leading edge to the status column's — the list's inset plus
/// `Space.base` on both sides. Each group has the footer's own padding, `Space.tight` above and
/// `Space.base` below, so the rule between them reads like the scroll-edge hairline above both.
///
/// Every window shows when it clears, so the row answers "how much is left, and until when?"
/// without being hovered. `ctx` and the Mac's readings are the exception and carry no clock: a
/// conversation's context is emptied by compaction, not by a reset time, and the Mac's are now.
/// Paying for the clock times in width rather than in a wider fill keeps the numbers glanceable;
/// ``Size/sidebarMinWidth`` is sized to the resulting common case.
///
/// Every ring and number is drawn in one of two inks, `Palette.text` or `Palette.amber` past the
/// warning threshold — for the Mac's readings, when macOS itself warns — whatever the agent is
/// doing: an idle vendor's last reading is still its reading, and a dimmed ring beside a bright one
/// reads as a different kind of mark. The backpack line is the one other colour.
