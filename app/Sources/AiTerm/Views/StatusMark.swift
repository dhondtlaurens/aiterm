/// The turning arc of a working mark. It does not poll a clock: it asks SwiftUI for one linear,
/// endlessly repeating turn, and SwiftUI interpolates that between frames without evaluating a
/// `body` — so any number of working rows cost no per-frame view work, nothing ticks once the last
/// one stops working (the arc is gone and its animation with it), and no timer is shared or owned.
///
/// The turn starts at `StatusMark.spinnerRotation(at:)` and lasts one `spinDuration`, so it stays
/// in step with that clock for as long as it runs: a row that comes back, or a second row that
/// starts later, still shows the phase every other arc shows. The seed is state, taken once: the
/// arc is built again whenever its mark's body runs (a hover or a selection changes the surface),
/// and a seed taken each time would move the arc off the clock with every one.
///
/// A list recycles a row's cell: the view leaves its window and comes back with its state kept and
/// its animation possibly dropped, which would leave a still arc. So an arc that appears a second
/// time is replaced by a new one, which seeds from the clock and starts its own turn. Replacing it
/// rather than rewinding it: a value set back and set forward again in one update never animates
/// from where it was set back to.
