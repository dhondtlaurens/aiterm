/// The 16 pt neutral-wash chip a sidebar row draws for a ticket key, a vendor mark or a `+n`
/// overflow count — one shape in place of the three types (`EditorBadge`, `JiraChip`,
/// `BranchLabelView`'s `+n` chip) that each redrew it. `action` carries whether the badge is a
/// button, so a badge with no action draws its shape only.
///
/// A `diff` extends the badge with signed line counts after its icon and label — `[mark] +12 −3`,
/// the VS Code badge on a row whose checkout has moved from the branch it started at. An empty diff
/// draws nothing extra, so a caller can pass one unconditionally.
///
/// A `.quiet` badge drops the box at rest: its mark and text sit on the row in secondary ink, and
/// the wash only appears under the pointer, outset by `Space.tight` so the text does not move. The
/// sidebar's project headers and task and terminal rows draw their badges this way, where four
/// boxes in a row read as clutter; everywhere else a badge keeps its box.
///
/// What this is *not*: a status count. `StatusCountChip` varies its tint, its ink and both its
/// fill and stroke opacity by status — a deliberate three-dimensional progression keyed to
/// urgency (muted/0.14/0.30 idle and working, amber/0.16/0.38 needs-input, accent/0.17/0.42 done),
/// not a single colour a caller could hand in. Carrying that into `Badge` would either need two
/// more parameters `Badge`'s only other shape has no use for, or flatten three real opacity pairs
/// into one and silently change two of the three statuses' pixels. Neither is acceptable, so
/// `StatusCountChip` stays its own component: a status chip that happens to be chip-shaped, not a
/// `Badge`.
