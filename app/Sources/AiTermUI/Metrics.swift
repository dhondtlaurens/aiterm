// Where macOS publishes a scale, these are *its* numbers rather than a house set: the system text
// styles, AppKit's control sizes and AppKit's corner radii. That is the whole argument for them —
// a new control takes its height, radius and text size from here instead of from whatever looked
// right beside its neighbour.
//
// A consistency audit (17 Sep 2026) counted nine text sizes, five corner radii, seventeen padding
// values, two chip heights and three sheet footers across `Views/` before this file existed. This
// file is the source of truth; see `app/Sources/AiTermUI/README.md`.
