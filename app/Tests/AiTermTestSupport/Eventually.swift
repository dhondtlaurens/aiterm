/// Waits for something a test expects to happen, instead of sleeping for as long as it usually
/// takes. A pass ends the moment `condition` holds, so the wait costs what the thing costs; only a
/// failure waits out `timeout`, which is `TestDeadline`'s so a loaded machine does not flake it.
///
/// `condition` is checked in the caller's isolation, between turns of its executor, so a test on
/// the main actor reads its own state and the thing it waits for can run on that actor meanwhile.
/// A timeout is recorded as an issue, at the caller's line and saying what was waited for, so a
/// caller that ignores the result still fails. It also returns whether the condition held, for a
/// test that wants to stop there (`try #require(await eventually …)`).
///
/// Only for what is *expected*. A test that shows something does not happen keeps a fixed window,
/// which stays as short as it can be.
///
/// The timeout counts the time the condition had to come true, not time the caller spent waiting
/// for a turn: a check that comes back later than ``lateTurn`` counts as that long. Under the
/// parallel runner a main-actor test's next check queues behind every other main-actor test the
/// runner has started — over ten seconds of their bodies, at the start of the app's run — and the
/// thing it waits for, due on the same actor a moment after the check was, queues right behind it.
/// Charged in full, that queue alone timed out a wait whose condition held at the very next check.
///
/// The wall clock still has the last word: a wait that has lasted ``wallClockFactor`` times its
/// timeout ends there, whatever it was charged, so a condition that never holds on a host that
/// stays busy fails within a minute rather than as long as the host is busy.
///
/// Neither ends the wait on a check that came back late, though, while it has not had the turn
/// after it: what came due while the caller was kept waiting is queued right behind that check,
/// so it gets one more turn — once, so a host that stays busy still ends the wait. A busy run
/// otherwise timed out a wait at a late check whose condition held at the next one.
