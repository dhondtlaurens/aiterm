/// A Unix-socket server a test writes in Python, for one that must behave differently from one
/// connection to the next, send events on its own, or hold a socket open while the test looks away:
/// what `FakeSocketServer`, which serves a single client from a handler, does not do.
///
/// The script is handed the socket path as `sys.argv[1]` and `arguments` after it, and binds and
/// listens itself. `start` returns once it listens, so a client that connects first does not have
/// to retry. The socket file is no sign of that: it appears at `bind`, and a connect between that
/// and `listen` is refused. So the script runs after ``listenSays``, and the helper waits for the
/// line it prints.
///
/// On the main actor because `Process` reports its end through the run loop of the thread that
/// launched it: `waitUntilExit` in `stop()` waits on the thread it is called from, and one launched
/// from a pool thread's run loop, which nobody turns, never wakes it.
