/// Resolves a `Color` to plain values so a test can compare colours by their rendered result
/// rather than by identity. Every colour is resolved under a forced `.darkAqua` appearance — AiTerm
/// is dark-only, and inheriting the process appearance instead would make a test's outcome depend
/// on the machine's system setting.
///
/// Test-only: this is not part of the design system's public surface, only a way for
/// `SurfaceTests` and `PaletteDistinctionTests` to ask "what colour does this actually resolve to."
///
/// `app/Sources/AiTermUI/IconSource.swift`'s `Icon.hexString(_:)` resolves colours the same
/// way, for a tinted mark's SVG fill rather than for a test assertion. The two are kept separate
/// deliberately (test-only vs. production), but they duplicate this exact `.darkAqua`/sRGB dance —
/// if one changes, check the other.
