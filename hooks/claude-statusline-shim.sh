# hooks/claude-statusline-shim.sh — installed as Claude Code's statusLine command by AiTerm.
# 1. forwards the statusline JSON to the AiTerm daemon (fire and forget, 300 ms cap)
# 2. preserves a previously configured status line, otherwise prints nothing.
# The statusLine callback supplies the usage payload. AiTerm uses it as a telemetry bridge,
# without adding its own terminal display or requiring a display preference.
# Claude Code runs this on every tick, so it starts nothing it can avoid: `-f` keeps zsh from
# sourcing the user's rc files, stdin is read with a builtin rather than a forked `cat`, and the
# two things it needs are plain-text files ClaudeDriver writes in the support folder: the hook port
# (AiTermPaths.hookPortURL; no port, no post) and the user's original command, run through `sh -c`
# as the agent itself would run it.
# The redirection wraps the whole backgrounded pipeline, not just curl: a redirection written after
# only the last command leaves printf's stderr pointed at this script's own — a grandchild holding
# that pipe open past the parent's exit, exactly the pattern ProcessRunner.swift warns about.
